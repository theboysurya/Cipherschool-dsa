### Features of Java

1. **Inspired by C and C++:** Java syntax is derived from C and C++, making it familiar to programmers who know these languages.
2. **Simple and Familiar:** Java is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a straightforward syntax and minimal complexities.
3. **Object-Oriented:** Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, which helps in organizing complex programs into simple, reusable pieces of code (objects).
4. **Platform Independent:** Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, following the principle of "write once, run anywhere."
5. **Compiled and Interpreted:** Java code is first compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the JVM, combining the benefits of both compilation and interpretation.
6. **Multi-Threaded:** Java supports multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.
7. **Dynamic:** Java programs can adapt to evolving environments by dynamically linking new class libraries, methods, and objects.
8. **Robust:** Java emphasizes early error checking, runtime checking, and eliminates certain types of programming errors through strong memory management and exception handling.
9. **Secure:** Java provides a secure execution environment by preventing the execution of untrusted code and protecting against security threats.
10. **High Performance:** Java achieves high performance through the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, which compile bytecode to native machine code at runtime.
11. **Portable:** Java code is portable across platforms as long as the platform supports JVM, ensuring that the same program can be executed on different systems without modification.
12. **Automatic Garbage Collection:** Java manages memory automatically through garbage collection, which identifies and discards objects that are no longer needed to free up resources.
